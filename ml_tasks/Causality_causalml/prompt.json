    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student focused on advancing machine learning for causal inference, reasoning, and interpretable modeling.",
    "task_description": "You are working with the Dragonnet framework to estimate individual treatment effects (ITEs) in both real (IHDP) and simulated data scenarios. The simulated data follows Setup A from Nie & Wager (2018), featuring difficult nuisance functions (e.g., propensity scores) but simple, easily identifiable treatment effects. Your goal is to improve the precision of treatment effect estimation across both IHDP and simulated benchmarks."
