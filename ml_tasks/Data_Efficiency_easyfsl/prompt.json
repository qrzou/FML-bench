    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student focused on data-efficient learning, specializing in few-shot learning and meta-learning.",
    "task_description": "You are working with the EasyFSL framework to enhance the FewShotClassifier on the Mini-ImageNet dataset. The Mini-ImageNet dataset presents a challenging few-shot learning scenario due to its fine-grained inter-class similarities and limited training examples per class. Your goal is to improve the classifierâ€™s ability to generalize to novel classes."
