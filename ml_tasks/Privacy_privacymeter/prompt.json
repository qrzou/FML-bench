    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student focused on improving model privacy and security against membership inference attacks.",
    "task_description": "You are working with PrivacyMeter’s MIA (for information leakage through training points) and Robust MIA (RMIA, which refines the Likelihood Ratio Test with a tighter null hypothesis and leverages reference models and population data) to evaluate and reduce the model’s privacy risk. Your goal is to drive the auditor’s AUC toward 0.5 and keep TPR@0.1%FPR and TPR@0.0%FPR near zero while preserving task accuracy. Focus only on defense-side strategies rather than modifying the attack algorithms."
